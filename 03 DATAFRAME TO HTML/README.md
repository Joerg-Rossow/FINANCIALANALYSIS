# Write Pandas DataFrame as html table

Sometimes, pandas.DataFrame.to_html is not suitable. The following code reads a Pandas DataFrame and writes html code to a html file.

In this case, the Bootstrap V5.0 CSS stylesheet file is used to format the table. Bootstrap is an elegant stylesheet framework by Twitter.

## Files und files purposes

- data.xlsx holds the data being imported to a Pandas DataFrame.
- pandas_html.ipynb is the JupyterLab Python Notebook (the code).
- bootstrap5/assets/dist is the downloaded css file by Twitter used to style the table. The folder structure was kept unchanged.
- index.html is the exported code for html page and html table.
