# Financial Data Wrangling within iPython

Welcome to our repository. You can find here examples to produce, process and analyze financial data with python. The focus is on data from Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) and Accounting departments within corporations. All data has been prepared for this purpose from a realistic digital financial model company which only exists as algorithms and data bases.

## Challenges within corporate FP&A

There are a number of daily challenges with financial planning, analysis and reporting. These often deal with media breaks, reconciling and the amount of financial data. Also often organizations try to solve new challenges with old apporaches. 

## Objectives of this repository

We try to upload useful python examples to solve typical challenges for a financial analyst responsible for budgeting, reporting and analysis within month and year end closing.
